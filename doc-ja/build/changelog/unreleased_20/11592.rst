    Fixed bug where the :meth:`.Operators.nulls_first()` and
    :meth:`.Operators.nulls_last()` modifiers would not be treated the same way
    as :meth:`.Operators.desc()` and :meth:`.Operators.asc()` when determining
    if an ORDER BY should be against a label name already in the statement. All
    four modifiers are now treated the same within ORDER BY.
