    Fixed issue in history_meta example where the "version" column in the
    versioned table needs to default to the most recent version number in the
    history table on INSERT, to suit the use case of a table where rows are
    deleted, and can then be replaced by new rows that re-use the same primary
    key identity.  This fix adds an additonal SELECT query per INSERT in the
    main table, which may be inefficient; for cases where primary keys are not
    re-used, the default function may be omitted.  Patch courtesy  Philipp H.
    v. Loewenfeld.
