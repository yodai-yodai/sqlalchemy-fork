    Fixed issue where using the :meth:`_orm.Query.enable_eagerloads` and
    :meth:`_orm.Query.yield_per` methods at the same time, in order to disable
    eager loading that's configured on the mapper directly, would be silently
    ignored, leading to errors or unexpected eager population of attributes.
