    Added a warning noting when an
    :meth:`_engine.ConnectionEvents.engine_connect` event may be leaving
    a transaction open, which can alter the behavior of a
    :class:`_orm.Session` using such an engine as bind.
    On SQLAlchemy 2.1 :paramref:`_orm.Session.join_transaction_mode` will
    instead be ignored in all cases when the session bind is
    an :class:`_engine.Engine`.
