    Follow up of :ticket:`11471` to fix caching issue where using the
    :meth:`.CompoundSelectState.add_cte` method of the
    :class:`.CompoundSelectState` construct would not set a correct cache key
    which distinguished between different CTE expressions. Also added tests
    that would detect issues similar to the one fixed in :ticket:`11544`.
