    Fixed issue where the :func:`_sql.collate` construct, which explicitly sets
    a collation for a given expression, would maintain collation settings for
    the underlying type object from the expression, causing SQL expressions to
    have both collations stated at once when used in further expressions for
    specific dialects that render explicit type casts, such as that of asyncpg.
    The :func:`_sql.collate` construct now assigns its own type to explicitly
    include the new collation, assuming it's a string type.
