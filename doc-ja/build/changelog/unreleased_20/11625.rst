    Fixed regression appearing in 2.0.21 caused by :ticket:`10279` where using
    a :func:`_sql.delete` or :func:`_sql.update` against an ORM class that is
    the base of an inheritance hierarchy, while also specifying that subclasses
    should be loaded polymorphically, would leak the polymorphic joins into the
    UPDATE or DELETE statement as well creating incorrect SQL.
