    Implemented two-phase transactions for the oracledb dialect. Historically,
    this feature never worked with the cx_Oracle dialect, however recent
    improvements to the oracledb successor now allow this to be possible.  The
    two phase transaction API is available at the Core level via the
    :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin_twophase` method.
